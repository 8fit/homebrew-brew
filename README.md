## What

This are our own homebrew repo for formulas, merely copying from the public https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core

## Why

What we have here is to keep the brew install from upgrading things in CI, and since version control with brew is usually not done right we need to have our own frozen copy of libraries.
